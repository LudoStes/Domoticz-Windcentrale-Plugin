# Windcentrale
**Beta!**
## Why?
The standard 'Winddelen' device only displays the current power of the windmill. This device gives you more detailed information about the production off the windmill, like current power, energy produced this year, windspeed, roation speed, etc.

## To do
- [ ] Add polling time
- [ ] Add 'Wind direction'. Didn't found a way to display this. The standard 'Wind' device, also display the wind speed in m/s. But we get only the wind speed in bft from windcentrale :(
- [ ] Add possibility to see the results from multiple windmills?
